# JS Functional Programming

This project demonstrates core concepts of functional programming in JavaScript, including:

- Function composition (`compose`, `pipeLine`)
- Currying and partial application
- Pure functions and immutability
- Array methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `some`, `every`

## Usage

Run the code with Node.js:

```sh
node app.js
```

## Key Functions

- `compose(...fns)`: Composes functions from right to left.
- `pipeLine(...fns)`: Composes functions from left to right.
- Examples of currying, partial application, and array utilities are included in [app.js](app.js).
